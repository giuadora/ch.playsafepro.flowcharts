# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-12)

**Core value:** Give playground owners a clear, norm-based understanding of what inspections are required, when, by whom, and what to do with the results — so they can fulfill their duty of care (Werkeigentumerhaftung, Art. 58 OR)
**Current focus:** Phase 8 - Node Enhancements (next)

## Current Position

Phase: 8 of 9 (Node Modifications & Norm Compliance)
Milestone: v2.0 Flowchart Split

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions from PROJECT.md affecting v2.0:

- **v1.0**: One flowchart with two entry paths (new + existing) - Now splitting into two separate flowcharts for better clarity
- **v1.1**: Simplified post-inspection flow from 10 nodes to 3 per user feedback
- **v1.2**: CDN-sourced logo and 3-column footer matching Offerte template
- **v2.0 Context**: Splitting based on color-coded sections in current flowchart (blue=new, green=existing)
- [Phase 07-01]: Split single flowchart with two entry paths into two focused flowcharts for clarity
- [Phase 07-01]: Retained original footnote numbering in FC2 to maintain consistency with node superscripts
- [Phase 08-02]: Renamed FC2 inspection types to SN EN 1176-7 standard terminology for professional compliance
- [Phase 08-02]: Changed P01 'Bericht archivieren' from gray terminal to green rectangle to visually align with inspection activities
- [Phase 08-02]: Completed footnote audit confirming all FC2 norm-referenced nodes have proper superscripts
- [Phase 08-01]: Applied green color scheme to FC1 N02 'Inspektion nach Installation' to match inspection activity semantics
- [Phase 08-01]: Rendered FC1 IPLAN 'Inspektionsplan erstellen' as subprocess symbol (shape=process) with double-bordered rectangle
- [Phase 08-01]: Added footnote ³ for Inspektionsplan referencing SN EN 1176-7 6.2.4, completing FC1 footnote audit

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. Phase 7 complete. Both flowcharts ready for Phase 8 node enhancements.
