Recent decisions:

- DEC-04-01-002: Manual repositioning chosen over proportional scaling for optimal readability
- DEC-04-01-003: Node sizing (100-120px wide) optimized for 8-10pt text readability when printed
- DEC-04-02-001: Simplified post-inspection flow (removed 10 nodes, replaced with 3-step linear path)
- DEC-04-02-002: CEN/TR 17207 classification as annotation instead of process step
- DEC-04-02-003: Footnote renumbering after P04 removal (8 footnotes)
- DEC-05-01-001: Git commit workflow blocked by directory rename — user manual commit required
