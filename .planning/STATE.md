# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-12)

**Core value:** Give playground owners a clear, norm-based understanding of what inspections are required, when, by whom, and what to do with the results — so they can fulfill their duty of care (Werkeigentumerhaftung, Art. 58 OR)
**Current focus:** Phase 7 - Flowchart Split & File Structure

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 9 (Flowchart Split & File Structure)
Milestone: v2.0 Flowchart Split
Plan: Ready to plan first phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-12 — Roadmap created for v2.0 milestone

Progress: [██████░░░░] 67% (6 of 9 phases complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 10
- Average duration: Not tracked yet
- Total execution time: 7 days across 3 milestones

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Milestone | Plans | Status |
|-------|-----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | v1.0 | 1 | Complete |
| 2 | v1.0 | 2 | Complete |
| 3 | v1.0 | 1 | Complete |
| 4 | v1.1 | 2 | Complete |
| 5 | v1.1 | 2 | Complete |
| 6 | v1.2 | 2 | Complete |
| 7 | v2.0 | TBD | Not started |
| 8 | v2.0 | TBD | Not started |
| 9 | v2.0 | TBD | Not started |

**Recent Trend:**
- v1.0 shipped in 1 day (4 plans)
- v1.1 shipped in 4 hours (4 plans)
- v1.2 shipped in 2 days (2 plans)
- Trend: Stable execution velocity

*Metrics will be updated after each plan completion in v2.0*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions from PROJECT.md affecting v2.0:

- **v1.0**: One flowchart with two entry paths (new + existing) - Now splitting into two separate flowcharts for better clarity
- **v1.1**: Simplified post-inspection flow from 10 nodes to 3 per user feedback
- **v1.2**: CDN-sourced logo and 3-column footer matching Offerte template
- **v2.0 Context**: Splitting based on color-coded sections in current flowchart (blue=new, green=existing)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet. All tooling from v1.2 (generate-pdf.sh, verify-a4.py) should work with both flowcharts.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-12
Stopped at: Roadmap creation complete for v2.0 Flowchart Split
Resume file: None
Next action: `/gsd:plan-phase 7` to plan the first phase of v2.0
