## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Fork-join pattern for parallel inspection branches | Clear entry/exit points for 3 inspection types |
| 1 | Parallelogram shape for document nodes | Visual distinction between process steps and documents |
| 1 | Color coding: blue=new, green=inspection, yellow=post, red=critical | Phase 2 Mermaid styling guidance |
| 2 | Dotted arrows for loop-back edges | Visual distinction for cycles |
| 2 | Text-based color labels in legend (no emojis) | FMT-04 compliance |
| 2 | Footnotes/legend as orphan Mermaid nodes | Self-contained exportable diagram |
| 3 | Improved color palette for draw.io | Better print/screen quality while maintaining semantic meaning |
| 3 | Top-to-bottom layout in draw.io | Natural reading flow |
| 3 | Individual text elements for footnotes/legend | Enable customer editing of each element |
| 3 | Branding area with dashed border | Easy logo replacement guidance |
