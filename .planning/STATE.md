## Accumulated Context

### v1.2 Phase Structure

**Phase 6: Corporate Branding** (7 requirements, 1 phase)
- Logo replacement in draw.io (LOGO-01)
- Logo in README (LOGO-02)
- 3-column footer structure + 3 column definitions (FOOT-01 through FOOT-04)
- SVG export regeneration (EXPORT-01)

**Coupling:** Logo, footer, and SVG are all modifications to same draw.io file, tightly coupled.

**Success Criteria:**
1. PSP logo visible in draw.io top-right area
2. 3-column footer with company, contact, legal info at bottom
3. Logo added to README
4. SVG export includes branding, A4 dimensions preserved
5. Professional appearance matching Offerte template

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full log.

**v1.2-specific:**
- Single phase due to tight coupling (logo + footer + export are all draw.io modifications)
- No content changes to flowchart logic
- Branding-only approach preserves existing A4 layout
- CDN-sourced logo (not embedded) to keep file size lean

### Pending Todos

- Plan Phase 6 (awaiting user approval of roadmap)
- Implement logo placement in draw.io
- Add 3-column footer to draw.io
- Update README with logo
- Regenerate SVG export
- Verify print quality at A4 scale
