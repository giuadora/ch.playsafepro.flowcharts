# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** Give playground owners a clear, norm-based understanding of inspection obligations per SN EN 1176-7, so they can fulfill their duty of care (Werkeigentumerhaftung, Art. 58 OR)

**Current focus:** v1.1 Print-Ready A4 -- Phase 5: Export and Documentation

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 5 (Export and Documentation)
Plan: 1 of 2 complete (awaiting git commits)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-10 -- Completed 05-01-PLAN.md (file work complete, git commits pending)

Progress: [#############░░░░░░░] 65% (v1.1: Phase 5 Plan 1 files complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7 (file work, commits pending)
- Average duration: 6 min
- Total execution time: 0.75 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 1 | 4 min | 4 min |
| 2 | 1 | 3 min | 3 min |
| 3 | 2 | 14 min | 7 min |
| 4 | 2 | 16 min | 8 min |
| 5 | 1 | 15 min | 15 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full log.

Recent decisions:
- DEC-04-01-001: A4 portrait page dimensions (794x1123px at 96 DPI)
- DEC-04-01-002: Manual repositioning chosen over proportional scaling for optimal readability
- DEC-04-01-003: Node sizing (100-120px wide) optimized for 8-10pt text readability when printed
- DEC-04-02-001: Simplified post-inspection flow (removed 10 nodes, replaced with 3-step linear path)
- DEC-04-02-002: CEN/TR 17207 classification as annotation instead of process step
- DEC-04-02-003: Footnote renumbering after P04 removal (8 footnotes)
- DEC-05-01-001: Git commit workflow blocked by directory rename — user manual commit required

### Pending Todos

- Manual git commits for Plan 05-01 (bash failure after directory rename)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Plan 05-01 file work complete but uncommitted due to bash failure after project root directory rename
- User must manually navigate to new directory and execute git commits
- See 05-01-SUMMARY.md for detailed commit instructions
- No blocker for Plan 05-02 execution (can proceed with file work)

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-10T11:37:00Z
Stopped at: Plan 05-01 file work complete (git commits pending user action)
Resume file: None

**Git status:** Uncommitted changes in new directory `/Users/jean-pierrekoenig/Documents/Projects/ch.playsafepro.flowcharts`
**Next action:** User executes manual git commits per 05-01-SUMMARY.md instructions, then proceed to Plan 05-02
