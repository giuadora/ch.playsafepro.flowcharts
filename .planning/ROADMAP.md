### Phase 6: Corporate Branding

**Goal:** Users see professional PSP branding (logo + footer) integrated into diagram and README, maintaining A4 print-ready format.

2. 3-column corporate footer at bottom of draw.io with company info, contact details, and legal notice
3. PSP logo added to README.md (linked or embedded)
4. SVG export regenerated and includes logo + footer with original A4 dimensions preserved
